write-linux-image`
======
script to (erase and) create partitions on specified hdd device, then copy master image to first partition

I wrote this bash script to "automate" the creation of the partitions and writing the master image into a hard disk.  I have to write a master image which was created using a normal install of linux mint mate, updated, and made into an "oem" by installing the oem-config package and running oem-config-prepare.

The script expects a symlink named latest.img which should point to the master image.
